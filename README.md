# LoraSetup

A repository for learning and experimenting with Lora (Low-Rank Adaptation) in Python.

## About Lora

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique for efficiently fine-tuning large language models and other neural networks. It works by freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks.
